## Project Description
This project presents a detailed analysis of sales data for a bank operating across the United Kingdom. Leveraging both Excel and Tableau, this comprehensive analysis offers stakeholders valuable insights into the store's performance based on the following regions (England, Scotland, Nothern Ireland, and Whales)
Excel Analysis:

Initially, the raw sales data was processed and analyzed using Excel. This involved tasks such as data cleaning and transforming the data in such a manner that the data is easily readable from a machine learning standpoint, and aggregation to derive meaningful insights. 

Tableau Integration:

Following the Excel analysis, the processed data was visualized and further analyzed using Tableau. The Tableau workbook serves as a dynamic platform for interactive visualization, allowing users to explore sales trends, regional variations in depth. Utilizing Tableau's rich features, such as dashboards, filters, and drill-down capabilities, users can interactively dissect the data to gain actionable insights.

## Findings:

### England:
